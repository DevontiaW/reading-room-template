## The Story

We wanted a way to pick books fairly, track what we'd read together, and have meaningful discussions. Every book club app we found was either too complex or too bare-bones. So we built **The Reading Room**—a warm, inviting space that treats reading as the communal experience it should be.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%" align="center">
<h3>Tufte-Inspired</h3>
<p>The data IS the graphic. Our bookshelf shows progress as actual book spines.</p>
</td>
<td width="33%" align="center">
<h3>Library Aesthetic</h3>
<p>Brass, walnut, and cream tones that feel like a cozy reading nook.</p>
</td>
<td width="33%" align="center">
<h3>Fair Randomization</h3>
<p>Series order is sacred. No spoilers, no confusion.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
